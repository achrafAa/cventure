# Chapter 2: Variables – The Magic Containers

In this chapter, you'll unlock the secrets of **variables**, the magical containers that store and manipulate data in your programs. Variables are essential to programming—they let you name, organize, and operate on the data that fuels your code’s logic and behavior.

---

## 2.1 Understanding Variables

Variables are like enchanted vessels. Each one has:
- **A name** – the label you use to access it.
- **A type** – the kind of data it can store.
- **A value** – the actual data inside it.

### 🔮 Naming Variables

Choose variable names with care. A good name makes your code readable and understandable:

```c
int age;      // ✅ clear and meaningful
int a;        // ❌ too vague
```

### 🧪 Variable Types

In C, you must declare a variable’s type when you create it—like defining the kind of magic it can hold:

- `int` – Whole numbers, like a spell count.
- `float` – Decimal numbers, like a potion’s volume.
- `char` – Single characters, like runes or initials.

---

## 2.2 Declaring and Initializing Variables

### ✨ Declaration

Declaring a variable reserves memory for it:

```c
int age;
float weight;
char grade;
```

### 💡 Initialization

Initializing means giving your variable a value from the start:

```c
int age = 25;
float weight = 63.5;
char grade = 'A';
```

Declaring **and** initializing is a good practice—it avoids unpredictable behavior from using "empty" containers.

## 2.3 Basic Data Types

### Integer Types

Integers are whole numbers. C offers several types based on size and range:

- `short` – Smaller integers (±32,768)
- `int` – Standard size (±2.1 billion)
- `long` – Larger integers
- `long long` – Very large integers

### Floating-Point Types

Used to represent real numbers with fractions:

- `float` – Single precision (~7 digits)
- `double` – Double precision (~15 digits)
- `long double` – Extended precision

### Character Type

Represents single characters using ASCII values:

- `char` – One byte, e.g., 'A', '$', '7'

---

## 2.4 Constants

Constants are immutable values—unchangeable once defined. They're ideal for values that stay the same throughout your program.

```c
const int DAYS_IN_WEEK = 7;
#define PI 3.14159
```

---

## 2.5 Type Conversion

Changing one data type into another—either implicitly or explicitly:

```c
int a = 5;
float b = a;        // implicit conversion
float c = 5.7;
int d = (int)c;     // explicit conversion
```

---

## 2.6 Scope and Lifetime

- **Scope** defines where a variable is accessible.
  - *Local*: Inside a function/block.
  - *Global*: Outside all functions, visible everywhere.

- **Lifetime** defines how long the variable exists in memory.

```c
void func() {
    int temp = 10;  // local scope and lifetime
}
int global_var = 20;  // global scope and program lifetime
```

---

## 2.7 Working with Variables

### 📥 Assignment

```c
int x = 10;
x = 20;  // reassign a new value
```

### ➕ Arithmetic

```c
int a = 5, b = 3;
int sum = a + b;  // 8
```

### 🔍 Comparison

```c
if (a > b) {
    // do something magical
}
```

## 🧹 Common Errors and Solutions

- **Uninitialized Variables** – Always initialize to avoid garbage values.
- **Type Mismatch** – Ensure types match when assigning or converting.
- **Scope Issues** – Don’t access variables outside their declared scope.
