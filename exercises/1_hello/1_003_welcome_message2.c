/**
 * Exercise: Welcome Message 2
 * 
 * Learn to display multi-line messages using a single printf statement.
 * 
 * Your task:
 * 1. Use only ONE printf statement to display a welcome message
 * 2. The first line should say: "Welcome to C programming!"
 * 3. The second line should say: "Let the adventure begin!"
 * 4. Make sure each message appears on its own line
 * 
 * Remember:
 * - To create a new line within a single printf, use the '\n' character
 * - The '\n' character tells the console to move to the next line
 * - Example: printf("Line 1\nLine 2");
