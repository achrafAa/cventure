/**
 * Exercise: Magic Calculator
 * 
 * Your magic academy needs a calculator to perform basic spell calculations.
 * 
 * Your task:
 * - Calculate and store the following in separate variables:
 *    - The sum of the two numbers
 *    - The difference between the first and second number
 *    - The product of the two numbers
 *    - The quotient when the first is divided by the second
 *    - The remainder when the first is divided by the second
