 * Exercise: Magic Variables
 * 
 * In the magical world of C, wizards store their spell components in variables.
 * Different components need different types of magical containers.
 * 
 * Your task:
 * 1. Declare and initialize the following variables:
 *    - wizard_level: an integer with value 42
 *    - spell_power: a floating-point with value 9.75
 *    - magic_symbol: a character with value '*'
 * 2. Keep the print statements as they are
