/**
 * Exercise: Foggy Labels â€“ Fix the Variable Names
 * 
 * A novice wizard wrote this code using unclear and cryptic variable names.
 * The spell still runs, but no one understands what it's doing!
 * 
 * Your task:
 * - Read the code and figure out what each variable likely represents.
 * - Replace the bad variable names with clear, meaningful ones.
 * - Keep the functionality exactly the same.
 * - Use comments to describe what each variable means.
