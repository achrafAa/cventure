Hint: Foggy Labels

Understanding the Exercise:
This exercise is about improving code readability by using meaningful variable names. The current code uses unclear variable names that make it hard to understand what the program is doing.

Tips:
1. Look at the printf statements to understand what each variable represents
2. Consider what these values might represent in a magical context:
   - A number that represents capacity
   - A decimal number that represents regeneration
   - A single character that represents a rank

Common Pitfalls:
- Don't change the values of the variables
- Don't modify the printf statements
- Don't change the data types of the variables

Expected Output:
The program should output exactly:
Mana Capacity: 50
Mana Regeneration: 73.2
Rank Symbol: R
