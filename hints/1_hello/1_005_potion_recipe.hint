Format specifiers in printf() let you insert variable values into your output.

Use these specifiers to match your variable types:
%d for integers
%f for floating-point numbers
%.2f for floating-point with 2 decimal places
%c for single characters
%s for strings

Example: printf("Name: %s, Age: %d", name, age);
